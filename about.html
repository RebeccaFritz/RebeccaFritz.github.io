        <p class="text-about-one">Hi, my name is Rebecca and this website is my attempt to bring a little bit more compassion and understanding into this world. I have noticed that there are a lot of misconceptions surrounding the world of Autism and what it means to be Autistic and I want to do my part to clear up some of those misunderstandings. On this website you can find out exactly what being Autistic means, what it means when someone says "Autism is a spectrum," and you'll even meet a few members of the Autistic community. Enjoy! I hope you learn something new!</p>
